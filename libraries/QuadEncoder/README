### What is this?

This is a library developed to help read the moves from
a quadrature rotary encoder.


### How to use this?

Copy the library directory into "libraries" sub-folder in your sketchbook.
More info at: http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Libraries

And you can use something like this on your project.

#include <QuadEncoder.h>

int qe1Move=0;
QuadEncoder qe(2,4);

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  qe1Move=qe.hb();
  if (qe1Move=='>')
    Serial.print(char(qe1Move));
  else if (qe1Move=='<')
    Serial.print(char(qe1Move));
}
